# P2_Banking_Industry – Customer Segmentation Project

This project presents a structured customer segmentation analysis using Microsoft Excel, developed for a fictional banking dataset. The goal is to enhance the bank’s understanding of its customer base, support targeted retention strategies, and enable more effective, data-driven business decisions.

## Executive Summary

The banking industry faces ongoing challenges including increasing customer churn, suboptimal marketing effectiveness, and limited service personalization. This project applies customer segmentation techniques to address these issues by analyzing key demographic and financial data.

The analysis enables the bank to:

- Identify and retain high-value customer segments
- Optimize marketing investments through targeted campaigns
- Align products and services more closely with customer needs
- Allocate resources efficiently across regions and customer groups

These insights provide a strategic foundation to enhance customer satisfaction, boost retention rates, and improve overall profitability.

## Methodology Overview

This project follows a structured, Excel-based workflow using Power Query and Power Pivot to segment customers and generate actionable insights. The methodology includes the following key steps:

- **Understanding Business Needs:** Identify the bank’s strategic challenges, including customer churn, inefficient marketing spend, and service misalignment across customer segments.
- **Customer Segmentation Framework:** Develop segmentation logic based on demographic (age group) and financial (account balance group) thresholds to categorize customers meaningfully.
- **Data Access and Consolidation:** ImAppend `Customer_Info` and `Account` sheets from multiple files, verify uniqueness, and use unique identifiers to prepare for accurate data merging.
- **Data Quality Review:** Assess data integrity by identifying missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers that could affect analysis quality.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Enhance data quality by addressing identified issues, merging customer and account datasets, applying necessary formatting, and transforming variables for segmentation.
- **Visualization and Analysis:** Pivot tables and Pie of Pie chart were used to summarize key performance metrics across defined customer segments.
- **Findings & Recommendations:** Translate findings into actionable recommendations to improve customer retention, refine marketing strategies, and optimize service delivery across customer groups.

## ## Reporting & Communication

### Key Findings

The analysis indicates that the bank's total balance is predominantly held by three customer segments: **Middle–High (39%)**, **Senior–High (34%)**, and **Young–High (25%)**. In contrast, the remaining segment labeled **"Other"** represents only **2%** of the overall balance.

These top segments comprise approximately **87% of the customer base**, yet they account for nearly **98% of the total balances**, highlighting a significant concentration of wealth among high-value customers.

### Recommendations

- **Retention of High-Value Customers:** To maintain long-term loyalty, the bank should prioritize these key segments by offering **premium services**, **personalized financial guidance**, and **exclusive investment opportunities** tailored to their needs.  
- **Engagement of Low-Balance Segments:**  Strengthening engagement with lower-balance customers through **targeted marketing efforts** and **user-friendly digital tools** can promote financial empowerment and encourage balance growth over time. 
- **Segmented Marketing by Age Group:**  A more effective marketing approach can be achieved by aligning offerings with customers’ life stages:
  - **Young Customers**: Introduce growth-oriented products such as investment accounts and education or housing loans.  
  - **Middle-Aged Customers**: Focus on long-term investment vehicles, mortgage products, and retirement planning solutions.  
  - **Senior Customers**: Emphasize wealth preservation strategies, including fixed deposits and low-risk income-generating investments.
