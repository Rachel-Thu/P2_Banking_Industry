# P2_Banking_Industry – Customer Segmentation Project

## Executive Summary

This project delivers a structured customer segmentation analysis using Microsoft Excel on a fictional banking dataset. The primary goal is to enhance the bank’s understanding of its diverse customer base to support targeted retention strategies and enable more effective, data-driven business decisions.

The analysis addresses key challenges faced by the bank, including customer churn, marketing effectiveness, product alignment, personalized service, resource allocation, and profitability optimization.

These insights provide a strategic foundation for improving customer satisfaction, loyalty, and overall business performance.

- Identify and retain high-value customer segments to reduce attrition  
- Tailor marketing campaigns to increase relevance and cross-selling opportunities  
- Inform product development and improvement aligned with customer needs  
- Enhance customer service personalization and efficiency  
- Allocate resources strategically across branches and regions  
- Maximize profitability by focusing on the most valuable segments

## Methodology Overview

This project follows a structured, Excel-based workflow using Power Query and Power Pivot to segment customers and generate actionable insights. The methodology includes the following key steps:

- **Understanding Business Needs:** Identify the bank’s strategic challenges, including customer churn, inefficient marketing spend, and service misalignment across customer segments.
- **Customer Segmentation Framework:** Develop segmentation logic based on demographic (age group) and financial (account balance group) thresholds to categorize customers meaningfully.
- **Data Access and Consolidation:** ImAppend `Customer_Info` and `Account` sheets from multiple files, verify uniqueness, and use unique identifiers to prepare for accurate data merging.
- **Data Quality Review:** Assess data integrity by identifying missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers that could affect analysis quality.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Enhance data quality by addressing identified issues, merging customer and account datasets, applying necessary formatting, and transforming variables for segmentation.
- **Visualization and Analysis:** Pivot tables and Pie of Pie chart were used to summarize key performance metrics across defined customer segments.
- **Findings & Recommendations:** Translate findings into actionable recommendations to improve customer retention, refine marketing strategies, and optimize service delivery across customer groups.

## ## Reporting & Communication

### Key Findings

The analysis indicates that the bank's total balance is predominantly held by three customer segments: **Middle–High (39%)**, **Senior–High (34%)**, and **Young–High (25%)**. In contrast, the remaining segment labeled **"Other"** represents only **2%** of the overall balance.

These top segments comprise approximately **87% of the customer base**, yet they account for nearly **98% of the total balances**, highlighting a significant concentration of wealth among high-value customers.

### Recommendations

- **Retention of High-Value Customers:** To maintain long-term loyalty, the bank should prioritize these key segments by offering **premium services**, **personalized financial guidance**, and **exclusive investment opportunities** tailored to their needs.  
- **Engagement of Low-Balance Segments:**  Strengthening engagement with lower-balance customers through **targeted marketing efforts** and **user-friendly digital tools** can promote financial empowerment and encourage balance growth over time. 
- **Segmented Marketing by Age Group:**  A more effective marketing approach can be achieved by aligning offerings with customers’ life stages:
  - **Young Customers**: Introduce growth-oriented products such as investment accounts and education or housing loans.  
  - **Middle-Aged Customers**: Focus on long-term investment vehicles, mortgage products, and retirement planning solutions.  
  - **Senior Customers**: Emphasize wealth preservation strategies, including fixed deposits and low-risk income-generating investments.
